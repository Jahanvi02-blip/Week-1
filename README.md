# Week-1
This is a data analysis of country - specific data for predicting CO2 emissions.


🌍 Climate Change Data Analysis | World Bank Group
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of climate change indicators using datasets provided by the World Bank Group. The goal of this project is to explore global climate trends, identify environmental challenges, and provide actionable insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.


📊 Dataset
Source: World Bank Open Data

Indicators analyzed include:

CO₂ emissions (metric tons per capita)

Methane emissions

Renewable energy consumption (% of total)

Temperature rise anomalies

Deforestation and forest area (% of land area)

Urban population growth

Energy use (kg of oil equivalent per capita)

🧪 Analysis Objectives
Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and merging relevant metadata.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understanding trends across countries, continents, and income groups.

Visualization
Using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for interactive charts and heatmaps.

Statistical Insights
Correlation between emissions and development indicators.

Regional Comparisons
Analysis of high-emission vs. low-emission regions.


🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebooks

Git & GitHub

Data sourced from the World Bank API and CSV downloads
